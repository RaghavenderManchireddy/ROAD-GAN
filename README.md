# ROAD-GAN
Road GAN enhances road images degraded by fog, rain, snow, and low light using GANs. With a U-Net generator, PatchGAN discriminator, and perceptual loss, it restores clarity while preserving vital features like lane markings and signs. Evaluated with SSIM and PSNR, it supports safer driving and AI-powered transportation systems.
